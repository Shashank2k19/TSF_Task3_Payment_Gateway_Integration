      <div class="panel-body"><h3>Spot The Paws - Saving India's Street Dogs</h3> <br>
      <p>
          Millions of stray dogs live on the streets of India. Most are direct descendants of their feral canine ancestors, a "breed" much older than any AKC (American Kennel Club) breed. With the recent increase in popularity among Indians of full breed dogs, more and more street dogs are abandoned pets or have bred with pet breeds.<br> <br> <br> 
          Although they are widely feared because some carry rabies, for the most part India's street dogs are not aggressive and will only bite if provoked. Indeed, many are fearful of humans and sadly, the dogs' fears are well founded.<br><br><br> 

          India's street dog population is closely associated with municipal sanitation practices – or neglect thereof. Because these homeless dogs often survive by scavenging rubbish, exposed garbage means more healthy dogs – and more puppies. Ironically, this actually makes the dogs a boon to public sanitation. By scavenging garbage, they reduce perishable waste that could otherwise be a source of contamination for people. And their presence around garbage keeps away other potentially dangerous scavengers, such as rats and mice.. <br><br><br>

          <b>Spot The Paws</b> channels your donations to both well-established and emerging Indian animal protection groups who confront daunting obstacles every day in their mission to rescue, shelter and fight for the rights of animals. We work closely with these groups and vouch for their courage, compassion and determination. Our guidance helps them improve their missions and operations so they can maximize their effectiveness as advocates for and defenders of the animals of India .</p>
